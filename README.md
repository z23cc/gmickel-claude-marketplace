## The Problem

Most AI agent failures aren't about model capability—they're about process:

- ✗ Starting to code before understanding the codebase
- ✗ Reinventing patterns that already exist in the repo
- ✗ Forgetting the original plan mid-implementation
- ✗ Missing edge cases that were obvious in hindsight

This marketplace ships plugins that fix these problems.

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/gmickel/gmickel-claude-marketplace
```

## Flow

**Plan first, work second.**

Most failures come from weak planning or drifting from the plan. Flow fixes both:

| Failure Mode | How Flow Fixes It |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Weak research | Parallel agents gather context *before* coding starts |
| Ignoring existing code | Explicit pattern reuse from your repo |
| Drifting from plan | Plan re-read between every task |
| Shallow self-review | Cross-model review via [RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com) (we recommend GPT-5.2 High) |

```bash
/plugin install flow
```

### Quick Start

```bash
/flow:plan Add OAuth login for users    # Research → plan → optional review
/flow:work plans/add-oauth-login.md     # Execute → test → ship → optional review
```

That's it. Two commands, one disciplined workflow.

### What Happens

**`/flow:plan`** runs 3 research agents in parallel, identifies gaps, writes a plan with acceptance checks, and optionally reviews via a different model.

**`/flow:work`** re-reads the plan before each task, implements following existing patterns, runs tests, and ships with a clear Definition of Done.

### Auto-Review

When [RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com) rp-cli is detected, both commands ask upfront:

```
Review — Run Carmack-level review after?
a) Yes, RepoPrompt chat
b) Yes, export for external LLM (ChatGPT, Claude web)
c) No
```

**Option a)**: Review via RepoPrompt's chat with a different model (we recommend GPT-5.2 High).

**Option b)**: Exports full context to a file you can paste into ChatGPT Pro, Claude web, or any LLM.

Cross-model review catches blind spots that same-model self-review misses.

### Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/flow:plan` | Research + produce `plans/<slug>.md` |
| `/flow:work` | Execute plan end-to-end with task tracking |
| `/flow:plan-review` | Carmack-level plan review via rp-cli |
| `/flow:impl-review` | Carmack-level implementation review (current branch) |

### Integrations

- **[RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com)** — Token-efficient codebase exploration + cross-model reviews
- **[Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)** — Dependency-aware issue tracking (auto-detected from `.beads/`)
