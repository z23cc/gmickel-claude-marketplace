## Why This Exists

Most AI agent failures aren't about model capability—they're about process. Agents start coding before understanding the codebase, reinvent patterns that already exist, and forget the original plan mid-implementation.

This marketplace contains plugins that fix those problems.

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/gmickel/gmickel-claude-marketplace
```

---

## Flow

**Two‑step workflow: plan first, work second.**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Weak research | Parallel agents gather context upfront |
| Ignoring existing code | Explicit reuse of repo patterns |
| Drifting from plan | Plan re‑read between every task |
| No review discipline | Built-in Carmack-level code reviews |
| Lost task state | Optional [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) integration for dependency-aware tracking |

```bash
/plugin install flow
```

### Quick Start

```bash
/flow:plan Add OAuth login for users
/flow:work plans/add-oauth-login.md
```

**Auto-review** (if [RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com) rp-cli installed):
Both commands detect rp-cli and ask upfront: "Run Carmack-level review?"
If yes, review runs automatically via a different model—we recommend GPT-5.2 High for cross-validation that catches blind spots same-model review misses.

**With Beads** (if `.beads/` configured):
```bash
/flow:work bd-a3f8e9   # Work on Beads epic with dependency tracking
```

### What's Included

| Type | Count | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|
| Commands | 4 | `/flow:plan`, `/flow:work`, `/flow:plan-review`, `/flow:impl-review` |
| Agents | 6 | repo-scout, practice-scout, docs-scout, gap-analyst, quality-auditor, context-scout |
| Skills | 6 | Progressive disclosure (~100 tokens at startup) |

Uses **progressive disclosure**—only name + description loaded at startup, full logic loads on-demand when triggered.
