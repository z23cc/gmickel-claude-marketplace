## The Problem

Process failures, not model failures:

- Starting to code before understanding the codebase
- Reinventing patterns already there
- Forgetting the plan mid-implementation
- Skipping edge cases obvious in hindsight

This marketplace ships plugins that fix these problems.

---

## Plugins

| Plugin | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| [**flow-next**](#flow-next) | Plan-first workflow with `.flow/` task tracking. Zero deps. Multi-user safe. **Recommended.** |
| ~~flow~~ | Legacy. Use flow-next instead. |

> **New here?** Install **flow-next**. It does everything flow does plus Ralph mode, better tooling, and active development. Flow is kept for existing users only.

---

## Flow-Next

🌐 **Prefer a visual overview?** See the [Flow-Next app page](https://mickel.tech/apps/flow-next) for diagrams and examples.

**Plan first, work second. Zero external dependencies.**

```bash
# 1. Install
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/gmickel/gmickel-claude-marketplace
/plugin install flow-next

# 2. Setup (recommended - adds CLI access + project docs)
/flow-next:setup

# 3. Use
/flow-next:plan Add a contact form with validation
/flow-next:work fn-1
```

**What setup unlocks:**
- CLI access: `flowctl epics`, `flowctl ready`, `flowctl show` (no Claude needed)
- Project docs: Adds instructions for other AI tools (Codex, Cursor, etc.)
- Local guide: `.flow/usage.md` reference

Idempotent - safe to re-run. Skip if you only need `/flow-next:plan` and `/flow-next:work`.

### Choose Your Path

| I want to... | Command | Automation Level |
|--------------|---------|------------------|
| Plan + work one task at a time | `/flow-next:work fn-1.1` | Manual |
| Plan an epic, work with reviews | `/flow-next:plan` -> `/flow-next:work fn-1` | Manual + optional review |
| Run overnight unattended | `/flow-next:ralph-init` -> `scripts/ralph/ralph.sh` | Full autonomous |

**Agents that finish what they start.**

### How to Start

**1. Write a short spec**

Start with a rough idea - 1-5 sentences describing what you want to build. Save it as a markdown file or just keep it in your head.

**2. Flesh it out (optional but recommended)**

```bash
/flow-next:interview "Add user authentication with OAuth"
# or point to a spec file:
/flow-next:interview specs/auth.md
```

The interview asks 40+ deep questions to surface edge cases, requirements, and decisions before you start coding.

**3. Plan it**

```bash
/flow-next:plan "Add user authentication with OAuth"
# or if you have a refined spec:
/flow-next:plan fn-1  # refine existing epic
```

Creates an epic with dependency-ordered tasks in `.flow/`.

**4. Work it**

Choose your mode:

```bash
# Interactive - one task at a time, full control
/flow-next:work fn-1.1

# Interactive - whole epic, still in Claude
/flow-next:work fn-1

# Autonomous - run overnight, walk away
/flow-next:ralph-init  # one-time setup
scripts/ralph/ralph.sh  # run from terminal
```

That's it. Spec -> Interview -> Plan -> Work.

### Why It Works

**You control the granularity:**
- `/flow-next:work fn-1.1` — one task at a time with full review cycles
- `/flow-next:work fn-1` — throw the whole epic at it, walk away

Either way you get the same guarantees: re-anchoring, evidence, cross-model review.

**No context length worries:**
- Planning ensures every task fits one work iteration
- Re-anchoring after each task (and after compaction) prevents drift
- Fresh context window every iteration in Ralph mode

**Reviewer as safety net:**
- If drift happens despite re-anchoring, a different model catches it
- Reviews block until `SHIP` verdict - no "LGTM with nits" that get ignored

**What reviewers check:**

| Plan Reviews | Implementation Reviews |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Completeness & feasibility | Correctness & simplicity |
| Architecture & scope | DRY & edge cases |
| Dependencies & risks | Test coverage & security |
| Task breakdown quality | Evidence of completion |

**Re-anchoring prevents drift:**

Before EVERY task, Flow-Next re-reads the epic spec, task spec, and git state from `.flow/`. This forces Claude back to the source of truth - no hallucinated scope creep, no forgotten requirements. In Ralph mode, this happens automatically each iteration.

Unlike agents that carry accumulated context (where early mistakes compound), re-anchoring gives each task a fresh, accurate starting point.

Bundles everything in a single Python script. No npm. No daemons. No config edits. Try it in 30 seconds. Uninstall by deleting `.flow/` (and `scripts/ralph/` if enabled).

## Ralph (Autonomous Mode)

> **⚠️ Safety first**: Ralph defaults to `YOLO=1` (skips permission prompts).
> - Start with `ralph_once.sh` to observe one iteration
> - Consider [Docker sandbox](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/claude-code/) for isolation

**Setup (one-time, inside Claude):**
```bash
/flow-next:ralph-init
```

Or from terminal without entering Claude:
```bash
claude -p "/flow-next:ralph-init"
```

**Run (outside Claude):**
```bash
scripts/ralph/ralph.sh
```

**How Ralph differs from other autonomous agents:**

Most agents gate by tests alone. Ralph adds production-grade quality gates:

- **Multi-model reviews**: Uses [RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com/?atp=KJbuL4) to send code to a *different* model. Two models catch what one misses.
- **Review loops until SHIP**: Reviews block progress until `<verdict>SHIP</verdict>`. Fix → re-review cycles continue until approved.
- **Receipt-based gating**: Every review must produce a receipt JSON proving it ran. No receipt = no progress. At-least-once delivery with idempotent retry—treats agent as untrusted actor; receipts are proof-of-work.

### Why Flow-Next Ralph vs Anthropic's ralph-wiggum?

Anthropic's official ralph-wiggum plugin uses a Stop hook to keep Claude in the same session. Flow-Next inverts this architecture for production-grade reliability.

| Aspect | ralph-wiggum | Flow-Next Ralph |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Session model** | Single session, accumulating context | Fresh context per iteration |
| **Loop mechanism** | Stop hook re-feeds prompt in SAME session | External bash loop, new `claude -p` each iteration |
| **Context management** | Transcript grows, context fills up | Clean slate every time |
| **Failed attempts** | Pollute future iterations | Gone with the session |
| **Re-anchoring** | None | Re-reads epic/task spec EVERY iteration |
| **Quality gates** | None (test-based only) | Multi-model reviews block until SHIP |
| **Stuck detection** | `--max-iterations` safety limit | Auto-blocks task after N failures |
| **State storage** | In-memory transcript | File I/O (`.flow/`, receipts, evidence) |
| **Auditability** | Session transcript | Per-iteration logs + receipts + evidence |

**The Core Problem with ralph-wiggum**

1. **Context pollution** - Every failed attempt stays in context, potentially misleading future iterations
2. **No re-anchoring** - As context fills, Claude loses sight of the original task spec
3. **Single model** - No external validation; Claude grades its own homework
4. **Binary outcome** - Either completion promise triggers, or you hit max iterations

**Flow-Next's Solution**

Fresh context every iteration + multi-model review gates + receipt-based proof-of-work.

Two models catch what one misses. Process failures, not model failures.

### Features

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Re-anchoring** | Before EVERY task, re-reads epic/task specs + git state. No drift. |
| **Multi-user safe** | Scan-based IDs. Soft claims via assignee. Actor auto-detect. |
| **Zero deps** | Bundled `flowctl.py`. No external CLI. Just Python 3. |
| **Non-invasive** | No daemons or CLAUDE.md edits. Delete `.flow/` (and `scripts/ralph/` if enabled) to uninstall. |
| **CI-ready** | `flowctl validate --all` exits 1 on errors. Drop into pre-commit or GitHub Actions. |
| **One file per task** | Merge-friendly. Conflict surface is minimal. |
| **Automated reviews** | Require [RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com/?atp=KJbuL4) (rp-cli). Without it, reviews are skipped. |
| **Dependency graphs** | Tasks declare blockers. Nothing starts until dependencies resolve. |
| **Auto-block stuck tasks** | After MAX_ATTEMPTS_PER_TASK failures (default 5), task is blocked with failure context. Prevents infinite retry loops. |

### Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/flow-next:plan` | Research, create epic + tasks in `.flow/` |
| `/flow-next:work` | Execute epic end-to-end, task by task |
| `/flow-next:interview` | Deep interview to flesh out a spec |
| `/flow-next:plan-review` | Carmack-level plan review via rp-cli |
| `/flow-next:impl-review` | Carmack-level impl review (current branch) |
| `/flow-next:ralph-init` | Scaffold autonomous loop in `scripts/ralph/` |
| `/flow-next:setup` | Install flowctl locally + add project docs |
| `/flow-next:uninstall` | Remove flow-next from project |

### Autonomous Flags

All commands accept flags to bypass interactive questions:

```bash
# Interactive (asks questions)
/flow-next:plan Add caching
/flow-next:work fn-1

# Autonomous (flags)
/flow-next:plan Add caching --research=grep --no-review
/flow-next:work fn-1 --branch=current --no-review

# Autonomous (natural language)
/flow-next:plan Add caching, use context-scout, skip review
/flow-next:work fn-1 current branch, no review
```
