**Plugins that make AI agents actually work.**

</div>

---

## The Problem

Most AI agent failures aren't about model capability. They're about process:

- Starting to code before understanding the codebase
- Reinventing patterns that already exist
- Forgetting the plan mid-implementation
- Skipping edge cases that were obvious in hindsight

This marketplace ships plugins that fix these problems.

## Plugins

| Plugin | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| [**flow-next**](#flow-next) | Plan-first workflow with `.flow/` task tracking. Zero deps. Multi-user safe. |
| [**flow**](#flow) | Full-featured plan+work with optional Beads integration |

---

## Flow-Next

> **Experimental.** Give it a spin. [Report issues.](https://github.com/gmickel/gmickel-claude-marketplace/issues)

**Plan first, work second. Zero external dependencies.**

```bash
/plugin install flow-next

/flow-next:plan Add a contact form with validation
/flow-next:work fn-1
```

### Why We Built This

AI agents fail in predictable ways: they forget the plan mid-task, skip steps, lose context in long sessions, and produce work that drifts from the original intent. Flow-Next is an orchestration layer that fixes these failure modes.

It gives agents structured task graphs with explicit dependencies, forces re-anchoring before every task, records evidence of completion, and optionally runs cross-model reviews. The result: agents that actually finish what they start.

We wanted all this without requiring external tools, config file edits, or background services. Flow-Next uses a bundled `flowctl.py` CLI and stores everything in `.flow/`. Try it in 30 seconds, remove it by deleting a folder.

### Features

| | |
|:--|:--|
| **Re-anchoring** | Before EVERY task, re-reads epic/task specs + git state. Per Anthropic's long-running agent guidance. No context drift. |
| **Multi-user safe** | Merge-safe IDs (scans files, no counters). Soft claims via assignee. Auto-detects actor from git email. Teams work parallel branches without coordination servers. |
| **Zero deps** | Bundled `flowctl.py`. No external CLI installs. Just Python 3. |
| **Non-invasive** | No hooks, daemons, or CLAUDE.md edits. Delete `.flow/` to uninstall completely. |
| **CI-ready** | `flowctl validate --all` exits 1 on errors. Drop into pre-commit or GitHub Actions. |
| **One file per task** | Merge-friendly. Conflict surface is minimal. |
| **Automated reviews** | Carmack-level plan + impl reviews via [RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com). Highly recommended. |
| **Dependency graphs** | Tasks declare blockers. Nothing starts until dependencies resolve. |

### Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/flow-next:plan` | Research, produce epic with tasks in `.flow/` |
| `/flow-next:work` | Execute epic end-to-end, task by task |
| `/flow-next:interview` | Deep interview to flesh out a spec |
| `/flow-next:plan-review` | Carmack-level plan review via rp-cli |
| `/flow-next:impl-review` | Carmack-level impl review (current branch) |

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/gmickel/gmickel-claude-marketplace
```

Then install whichever plugin you want:

```bash
/plugin install flow-next    # Recommended: zero deps, simpler
/plugin install flow         # If you use Beads or want plan files
```

---

## Flow

> **Requires RepoPrompt v1.5.62+** for review features.
> Using older RepoPrompt? Downgrade: `/plugin install flow@0.8.0`

**Plan first, work second.** The original, with optional Beads integration.

```bash
/plugin install flow

/flow:plan Add OAuth login for users
/flow:work plans/add-oauth-login.md
```

### How It Works

| Failure Mode | How Flow Fixes It |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Weak research | Parallel agents gather context *before* coding starts |
| Ignoring existing code | Explicit pattern reuse from your repo |
| Drifting from plan | Plan re-read between every task |
| Shallow self-review | Cross-model review via RepoPrompt |

### Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/flow:plan` | Research + produce `plans/<slug>.md` |
| `/flow:work` | Execute plan end-to-end with task tracking |
| `/flow:interview` | Deep interview to flesh out spec/bead |
| `/flow:plan-review` | Carmack-level plan review via rp-cli |
| `/flow:impl-review` | Carmack-level impl review (current branch) |

### Integrations

- **[RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com)** for token-efficient codebase exploration + cross-model reviews
- **[Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)** for dependency-aware issue tracking (auto-detected)
