# Changelog

All notable changes to the gmickel-claude-marketplace.

## [flow-next 0.3.12] - 2026-01-09

### Changed
- Optimized `/flow-next:setup` to minimize context footprint
  - CLAUDE.md snippet now minimal (~20 lines) with rules + quick commands
  - Full reference moved to `.flow/usage.md` (loaded on demand)
  - Added `<!-- BEGIN/END FLOW-NEXT -->` delimiters for idempotent updates

## [flow-next 0.3.11] - 2026-01-09

### Changed
- Expanded CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md template with file structure, workflow, and rules
- Improved `flow-next` skill trigger phrases ("show me my tasks", "list epics", etc.)

## [flow-next 0.3.10] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- Clarified `/flow-next:setup` idempotency for existing `.flow/` directories
  - Safe to re-run; preserves existing epics/tasks
  - Clear version comparison logic for updates

## [flow-next 0.3.9] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- **`flow-next` skill**: General task management skill for quick operations
  - Triggers on: "add task", "show tasks", "what's ready", etc.
  - Provides flowctl path setup and CLI quick reference
  - Prevents agents from struggling to find/use flowctl
- **`/flow-next:setup` command**: Optional local install for power users
  - Copies flowctl scripts to `.flow/bin/` for CLI access

  - **Fully optional** - standard plugin usage works without this

### Notes
- Setup is opt-in only; flow-next continues to work via plugin as before
- Re-run `/flow-next:setup` after plugin updates to refresh local scripts

## [flow-next 0.3.7] - 2026-01-09

### Ralph: Autonomous Coding with Multi-Model Review Gates

This release introduces **Ralph**, a production-ready autonomous coding loop that goes beyond simple "code until tests pass" agents. Ralph implements **multi-model review gates** using [RepoPrompt](https://repoprompt.com) to send your plans and implementations to a different AI model for review.

**Why Ralph is different:**

- **Two-model review**: Your code is reviewed by a separate model (we recommend GPT-5.2 High), catching blind spots that self-review misses
- **Review loops until SHIP**: No "LGTM with nits" that get ignored—reviews block progress until the reviewer returns `<verdict>SHIP</verdict>`
- **Receipt-based gating**: Every review must produce a receipt proving it ran. No receipt = no progress. This prevents the agent from skipping steps
- **Guard hooks**: Deterministic enforcement of workflow rules—the agent can't drift from the prescribed flow

**Getting started:**

```bash
/flow-next:ralph-init    # Set up Ralph in your repo
scripts/ralph/ralph.sh   # Run the autonomous loop
```

See the [Ralph documentation](plugins/flow-next/docs/ralph.md) for the full guide.

### Technical Details

**Guard hooks** (only active when `FLOW_RALPH=1`):
- Block impl receipts unless `flowctl done` was called
- Block receipts missing required `id` field
- Warn on informal approvals without verdict tags
- Zero impact for non-Ralph users

**Autonomous mode system prompt** ensures the agent follows instructions precisely when running unattended.

</details>

## [flow-next 0.2.0] - 2026-01-07

### Added
- **Autonomous mode flags**: All commands now accept flags to bypass interactive questions
  ```bash
  # Interactive (asks questions)
  /flow-next:plan Add caching
  /flow-next:work fn-1

  # Autonomous (flags)
  /flow-next:plan Add caching --research=grep --no-review
  /flow-next:work fn-1 --branch=current --no-review

  # Autonomous (natural language)
  /flow-next:plan Add caching, use context-scout, skip review
  /flow-next:work fn-1 current branch, no review
  ```
  - `/flow-next:plan`: `--research=rp|grep`, `--review=rp|export|none`, `--no-review`
  - `/flow-next:work`: `--branch=current|new|worktree`, `--review=rp|export|none`, `--no-review`
  - `/flow-next:plan-review`: `--mode=rp|export`
  - `/flow-next:impl-review`: `--mode=rp|export`
- Natural language parsing also works ("use context-scout", "skip review", "current branch")
- First step toward fully autonomous Flow-Next operation

### Fixed
- Homepage URL now points to `/apps/flow-next` instead of `/apps/flow`

## [0.8.2] - 2026-01-06

### Changed
- **Re-review messages now require detailed fix explanations**
  - Template includes: what was wrong → what changed → why that approach
  - Plan reviews: section changes summary, trade-offs acknowledged
  - Impl reviews: file-by-file changes summary, architectural decisions
  - Helps reviewer understand HOW fixes were made, not just "trust me"
- **Fixed linebreak escaping in re-review messages**
  - Use raw `call chat_send` with JSON for multi-line messages
  - Bash single quotes don't interpret `\n` - now documented
- Added "Why detailed re-review messages?" explanation to both workflows

## [0.8.1] - 2026-01-06

### Changed
- **RepoPrompt v1.5.62+ now required** for review features
  - New `-t` flag for direct tab targeting (cleaner than `workspace tab` chaining)
  - Progress notifications during builder/chat execution
  - Updated all rp-cli references and examples
- **Re-review loop clarified**: Skip builder on re-reviews—discovery is done
  - Chat already has full context from initial review
  - Just augment selection with any files touched during fixes
  - Continue existing chat, don't start fresh
- Added "Why skip builder on re-reviews?" explanation to both workflows
- Downgrade path: `flow@0.8.0` for users on older RepoPrompt versions

## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-05

### Changed
- **Review workflows now use "Context Over Convenience" approach**
  - Builder prompt simplified to intent only (e.g., "Review implementation of OAuth on current branch")
  - No longer stuffs builder with file lists or module details—let Builder discover context
  - Builder's handoff prompt becomes foundation; review criteria added on top (not replaced)
  - Explicit step to capture and reuse Builder's handoff prompt via `prompt get`
- **New philosophy section** at top of both workflow files
  - Introduces "RepoPrompt's Context Builder" once, then refers to it as "Builder"
- **New anti-patterns**: "Stuffing builder prompt", "Ignoring builder's handoff prompt"
- Phase 1 now composes concise summary (flexible: 1-2 sentences for simple, paragraph for complex epics)
- Phase 2/3 renamed to "Context Discovery & Selection" with clearer 4-step process:
  1. Run builder with intent
  2. Capture handoff prompt
  3. Review and augment selection
  4. Verify final selection
- Builder wait warning now explicitly says "do NOT send another builder command"
- Review criteria condensed (same content, fewer tokens)

### Why This Change
Builder is AI-powered—its strength is discovering related patterns, architectural context, and dependencies the reviewer needs. We already know the changed files/plan file; Builder's job is finding surrounding context. Previous approach was too prescriptive.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-01-04

### Changed
- Renamed `interview` skill to `flow-interview` (pattern consistency)
- Extracted question categories to `questions.md` (like `flow-work` has `phases.md`)
- SKILL.md now references `questions.md` for interview guidelines

## [0.7.6] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- Stronger AskUserQuestion requirement with anti-pattern example

## [0.7.5] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- Interview skill now explicitly requires AskUserQuestion tool (was outputting questions as text)

## [0.7.4] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- `/flow:interview` command + `interview` skill
  - Deep interview about a spec/bead (40+ questions for complex features)
  - Accepts beads ID or file path
  - Writes refined spec back to source
  - Optional step before `/flow:plan` for thorough requirements gathering

## [0.7.3] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- Codex CLI install script (`scripts/install-codex.sh`)
  - Copies skills and prompts to `~/.codex/`
  - Note: subagents won't run (Codex limitation), core flow still works

## [0.7.2] - 2026-01-02

### Changed
- Review skills now check conversation context before asking mode question
  - If mode already chosen in `/flow:plan` or `/flow:work` setup → use it, don't ask again
  - Only asks when invoked directly without prior context

## [0.7.1] - 2026-01-02

### Changed
- Clarified review mode question: both modes use RepoPrompt for context building, difference is where review happens

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- **Export for external review**: Review skills now offer export mode for ChatGPT Pro, Claude web, etc.
  - `/flow:plan` and `/flow:work` setup questions now have 3 review options:
    - `a) Yes, RepoPrompt chat` (default)
    - `b) Yes, export for external LLM`
    - `c) No`
  - Direct `/flow:impl-review` and `/flow:plan-review` ask upfront which mode to use
  - Export mode: same context building, exports to `~/Desktop/` and opens file
  - Uses new RepoPrompt 1.5.61 `prompt export` command

### Changed
- Updated rp-cli references for RepoPrompt 1.5.61:
  - `workspace tabs` shorthand (replaces verbose `call manage_workspaces`)
  - `workspace tab "name"` shorthand for tab selection
  - `prompt export /path.md` for full context export
  - Workflow shorthand flags (`--export-prompt`, `--export-context`)
  - Note: chats are now bound to compose tabs

## [0.6.5] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- Remove "Top 3 changes" from review output format
  - Agents were only fixing top 3 instead of ALL Critical/Major/Minor issues
  - Added explicit instruction: list ALL issues, agent will fix all of them
  - Applies to both plan-review and impl-review workflows

## [0.6.4] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
- Clarified valid reasons to skip a fix in reviews:
  - Reviewer lacked context (missed constraint/related code)
  - Reviewer misunderstood requirement/intent
  - Fix would break something else
  - Conflicts with established patterns
  - Must explain reasoning in re-review message

## [0.6.3] - 2025-12-30

  - Explicit: Critical/Major/Minor MUST be fixed, only Nitpick is optional
  - Added anti-pattern: "Skipping Minor issues"
  - Updated both plan-review and impl-review workflows

## [0.6.2] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- Clarified JSON escaping for chat_send in review workflows
  - Message must use `\n` for newlines, not literal line breaks
  - Removed broken heredoc pattern that caused JSON parse errors
  - Added note to keep message concise (chat sees selected files)

## [0.6.1] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- Added fix-and-re-review loop to plan/impl review workflows
  - Agents were documenting issues instead of fixing them during re-review
  - Now explicitly instructs to implement all fixes directly
  - Escape hatch for genuine disagreements preserved
  - Updated anti-patterns to flag "documenting instead of fixing"

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-30

### Added
- Tab isolation docs for parallel agents using rp-cli (#3)
  - `builder` auto-creates isolated compose tabs
  - Chain commands to maintain tab context: `builder "..." && select add && chat`
  - Rebind by tab name for separate invocations
  - Updated: flow-plan-review, flow-impl-review workflows
  - Updated: context-scout agent, rp-explorer skill

## [0.5.16] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- Fixed new chat creation in reviews (shorthand `--new-chat` is broken in rp-cli)
  - Initial review now uses `call chat_send {"new_chat": true, ...}` (works)
  - Re-review uses shorthand `chat "..." --mode chat` (continues existing)
  - Updated both workflow.md and rp-cli-reference.md files

## [0.5.15] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- Made review-fix-review loop fully automated (no human gates)
  - flow-work Phase 7: explicit "do NOT ask for confirmation"
  - flow-plan Step 5: same fix
  - Removed "ask before closing final tasks" ambiguity
  - Reviews now auto-fix and re-run until "Ship"

## [0.5.14] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- Removed redundant "Go ahead to start?" confirmation in flow-work
  - User already consented via setup questions
  - Only ask if something is actually unclear or blocking

## [0.5.13] - 2025-12-29

### Changed
- Replaced AskUserQuestion with text-based questions in flow-plan and flow-work
  - Better for voice dictation users
  - Supports terse replies ("1a 2b") and natural language rambling
  - All questions visible at once
  - Explicit "do NOT use AskUserQuestion tool" instruction

## [0.5.12] - 2025-12-29

### Added
- Issue quality guidelines in review prompts (inspired by OpenAI Codex)
  - impl-review: only flag issues **introduced by this change**
  - Both: cite **actual affected code** (no speculation)
  - Both: specify **trigger conditions** (inputs, edge cases)

## [0.5.11] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- Restructured chat command examples so `--new-chat` flags aren't buried

## [0.5.10] - 2025-12-29

### Added
- Chat session targeting for re-reviews
  - `chats list` → get chat IDs and names
  - `--chat-id <id>` → continue specific chat

### Fixed
- Clarified new-chat behavior in review workflows

## [0.5.8] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- Added prominent "CRITICAL" instruction for chat management in review workflows

## [0.5.7] - 2025-12-29

### Changed
- Merged redundant verify phases in review workflows
  - `flow-plan-review`: Phase 2+3 → "Build Context & Verify Selection"
  - `flow-impl-review`: Phase 3+4 → "Build Context & Verify Selection"
  - Agent now adds all supporting docs found in earlier phases after builder runs
  - Eliminates duplicate "check for PRD" instructions

## [0.5.6] - 2025-12-29

### Changed
- Improved skill descriptions to explicitly mention Beads issue ID support
  - `flow-plan`: now triggers on issue IDs (e.g., bd-123, gno-45)
  - `flow-work`: now triggers on epic/issue IDs for execution

## [0.5.4] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **New skill: `rp-explorer`** - Token-efficient codebase exploration via rp-cli
  - Deliberate activation: triggers on "use rp", "use repoprompt", explicit requests
  - Includes full rp-cli command reference (progressive disclosure)

### Changed
- `/flow:plan` now asks two setup questions when rp-cli detected:
  - Q1: Research approach (context-scout vs repo-scout)
  - Q2: Auto-review preference
- Updated README with comparison table and SETUP phase diagram

## [0.5.3] - 2025-12-28

### Changed
- Documented cross-model review benefit (GPT-5.2 High, o3 for validation)

## [0.5.2] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **New agent: `context-scout`** - Token-efficient codebase exploration using RepoPrompt's rp-cli
  - Uses `structure` for code signatures (10x fewer tokens than full files)
  - Uses `builder` for AI-powered file discovery
  - Comprehensive workflow: window setup → explore → summarize

### Changed
- **Improved all 6 agents** with proper configuration and detailed prompts:
  - Added `tools` field - each agent now has only the tools it needs
  - Added `model` field - scouts use `haiku` (fast), analysts use `sonnet` (reasoning)
  - Detailed search/analysis methodologies
  - Structured output formats for consistent, actionable results
  - Clear rules on what to focus on and what to skip

### Technical
- All 6 agents use opus model with full research toolkit: Read/Grep/Glob/Bash/WebSearch/WebFetch
- Explicitly excludes Edit/Write (read-only), Task (no sub-agents), TodoWrite/AskUserQuestion (parent manages)

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Auto-offer review**: Both `flow-plan` and `flow-work` now detect if rp-cli is installed and offer Carmack-level review
  - `flow-plan`: After writing plan, offers `/flow:plan-review` before next steps
  - `flow-work`: After shipping, offers `/flow:impl-review` with fix-and-iterate loop
- Eliminates need for manual chaining like "then review with /flow:impl-review"

### Changed
- `flow-work`: Branch setup question now in SKILL.md (first thing shown, cannot be skipped)
- Explicit examples of chained instructions in skill inputs

### Fixed
- Review commands now have explicit wait instructions for rp-cli chat responses (1-5+ min timeout)

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- **Beads integration**: Optional Beads (`bd`) support for flow skills
  - `flow-plan`: Can create Beads epics/tasks instead of markdown plans
  - `flow-work`: Can accept Beads IDs/titles, track via `bd ready`/`bd update`/`bd close`
  - `flow-plan-review`: Can accept Beads IDs/titles as input
  - `flow-impl-review`: Looks for Beads context during code review
- Graceful fallback to markdown/TodoWrite when `bd` unavailable
- Context recovery guidance per Anthropic's long-running agent best practices

### Technical
- Agent-first design: no rigid detection gates, uses judgment based on context
- Validated against bd v0.38.0
- CLI behavior documented in plan (ID formats, parent linking, scoped ready)

## [0.3.7] - 2024-12-27

### Added
- `/flow:plan-review` command: Carmack-level plan review via rp-cli context builder + chat
- `/flow:impl-review` command: Carmack-level implementation review of current branch changes
- `flow-plan-review` skill: progressive disclosure with workflow.md + rp-cli-reference.md
- `flow-impl-review` skill: progressive disclosure with workflow.md + rp-cli-reference.md

### Technical
- Both review skills use rp-cli for context building and chat-based review
- Shared rp-cli-reference.md for CLI command reference
- Commands are thin wrappers (~15 lines) invoking skills

## [0.2.3] - 2024-12-27

### Fixed
- Use "subagent" terminology consistently (official Claude Code term)

## [0.2.2] - 2024-12-27

### Fixed
- Use namespaced agent names (`flow:repo-scout`, `flow:practice-scout`, etc.) in skill reference files
- Make workflow file references directive ("Read and follow" instead of passive links)

## [0.2.1] - 2024-12-27

### Changed
- **Progressive disclosure for Skills**: SKILL.md files now contain only overview + links to reference files
- `flow-plan`: 117 → 30 lines in SKILL.md, detailed steps moved to `steps.md` and `examples.md`
- `flow-work`: 95 → 27 lines in SKILL.md, phases moved to `phases.md`
- Context usage reduced: ~100-150 tokens per skill at startup instead of 400-700

## [0.2.0] - 2024-12-27

### Added
- `flow-plan` skill: planning workflow logic extracted from command
- `flow-work` skill: execution workflow logic extracted from command

### Changed
- **Commands → Skills refactor**: `/flow:plan` and `/flow:work` are now thin wrappers (~15 lines each) that invoke Skills
- Skills enable auto-triggering based on description matching (e.g., "plan out adding OAuth" triggers `flow-plan`)
- Updated manifests: 1 skill → 3 skills

### Technical
- Commands reduced from ~2.1k and ~2.4k tokens to ~36 and ~38 tokens
- Full logic loads on-demand when skill is triggered

## [0.1.1] - 2024-12-26

### Changed
- Moved commands to `commands/flow/` subdirectory for prefixed naming (`/flow:plan`, `/flow:work`)
- Renamed commands for clarity
