# Changelog

All notable changes to the gmickel-claude-marketplace.

## [0.2.3] - 2024-12-27

### Fixed
- Use "subagent" terminology consistently (official Claude Code term)

## [0.2.2] - 2024-12-27

### Fixed
- Use namespaced agent names (`flow:repo-scout`, `flow:practice-scout`, etc.) in skill reference files
- Make workflow file references directive ("Read and follow" instead of passive links)

## [0.2.1] - 2024-12-27

### Changed
- **Progressive disclosure for Skills**: SKILL.md files now contain only overview + links to reference files
- `flow-plan`: 117 → 30 lines in SKILL.md, detailed steps moved to `steps.md` and `examples.md`
- `flow-work`: 95 → 27 lines in SKILL.md, phases moved to `phases.md`
- Context usage reduced: ~100-150 tokens per skill at startup instead of 400-700

## [0.2.0] - 2024-12-27

### Added
- `flow-plan` skill: planning workflow logic extracted from command
- `flow-work` skill: execution workflow logic extracted from command

### Changed
- **Commands → Skills refactor**: `/flow:plan` and `/flow:work` are now thin wrappers (~15 lines each) that invoke Skills
- Skills enable auto-triggering based on description matching (e.g., "plan out adding OAuth" triggers `flow-plan`)
- Updated manifests: 1 skill → 3 skills

### Technical
- Commands reduced from ~2.1k and ~2.4k tokens to ~36 and ~38 tokens
- Full logic loads on-demand when skill is triggered

## [0.1.1] - 2024-12-26

### Changed
- Moved commands to `commands/flow/` subdirectory for prefixed naming (`/flow:plan`, `/flow:work`)
- Renamed commands for clarity
- Updated argument hints

### Added
- Semver bump script for version management

## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-26

### Added
- Initial release of Flow plugin
- `/flow:plan` command: research + produce `plans/<slug>.md`
- `/flow:work` command: execute a plan end-to-end
- 5 agents: `repo-scout`, `practice-scout`, `docs-scout`, `flow-gap-analyst`, `quality-auditor`
- `worktree-kit` skill for safe parallel git workspaces
- Issue creation integration (GitHub, Linear, Beads)
- Marketplace structure with plugin manifest
