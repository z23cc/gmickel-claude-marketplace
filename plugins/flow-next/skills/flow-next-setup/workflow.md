# Flow-Next Setup Workflow

Follow these steps in order. This workflow is **idempotent** - safe to re-run.

## Step 0: Resolve plugin path

The plugin root is the parent of this skill's directory. From this SKILL.md location, go up to find `scripts/` and `.claude-plugin/`.

Example: if this file is at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../flow-next/0.3.12/skills/flow-next-setup/workflow.md`, then plugin root is `~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../flow-next/0.3.12/`.

Store this as `PLUGIN_ROOT` for use in later steps.

## Step 1: Check .flow/ exists

Check if `.flow/` directory exists (use Bash `ls .flow/` or check for `.flow/meta.json`).

- If `.flow/` exists: continue
- If `.flow/` doesn't exist: create it with `mkdir -p .flow` and create minimal meta.json:
  ```json
  {"schema_version": 2, "next_epic": 1}
  ```

Also ensure `.flow/config.json` exists with defaults:
```bash
if [ ! -f .flow/config.json ]; then
  echo '{"memory":{"enabled":false}}' > .flow/config.json
fi
```

## Step 2: Check existing setup

Read `.flow/meta.json` and check for `setup_version` field.

Also read `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to get current plugin version.

**If `setup_version` exists (already set up):**
- If **same version**: tell user "Already set up with v<VERSION>. Re-run to update docs only? (y/n)"
  - If yes: skip to Step 6 (docs)
  - If no: done
- If **older version**: tell user "Updating from v<OLD> to v<NEW>" and continue

**If no `setup_version`:** continue (first-time setup)

## Step 3: Create .flow/bin/

```bash
mkdir -p .flow/bin
```

## Step 4: Copy files

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT read flowctl.py - it's too large. Just copy it.**

Copy using Bash `cp` with absolute paths:

```bash
cp "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/flowctl" .flow/bin/flowctl
cp "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/flowctl.py" .flow/bin/flowctl.py
chmod +x .flow/bin/flowctl
```

Then read [templates/usage.md](templates/usage.md) and write it to `.flow/usage.md`.

## Step 5: Update meta.json

Read current `.flow/meta.json`, add/update these fields (preserve all others):

```json
{
  "setup_version": "<PLUGIN_VERSION>",
  "setup_date": "<ISO_DATE>"
}
```

## Step 6: Check and update documentation

Read the template from [templates/claude-md-snippet.md](templates/claude-md-snippet.md).

For each of CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md:
1. Check if file exists
2. If exists, check if `<!-- BEGIN FLOW-NEXT -->` marker exists
3. If marker exists, extract content between markers and compare with template

Determine status for each file:
- **missing**: file doesn't exist or no flow-next section
- **current**: section exists and matches template
- **outdated**: section exists but differs from template

Based on status:

**If both are current:**
```
Documentation already up to date (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md).
```
Skip to Step 7.

**If one or both need updates:**
Show status and ask:
```
Documentation status:
- CLAUDE.md: <missing|current|outdated>
- AGENTS.md: <missing|current|outdated>

Update docs? (Only showing files that need changes)
1. CLAUDE.md only
2. AGENTS.md only
3. Both
4. Skip

(Reply: 1, 2, 3, or 4)
```
Only show options for files that are missing or outdated.

Wait for response, then for each chosen file:
1. Read the file (create if doesn't exist)
2. If marker exists: replace everything between `<!-- BEGIN FLOW-NEXT -->` and `<!-- END FLOW-NEXT -->` (inclusive)
3. If no marker: append the snippet

## Step 7: Print summary

```
Flow-Next setup complete!

Installed:
- .flow/bin/flowctl (v<VERSION>)
- .flow/bin/flowctl.py
- .flow/usage.md

To use from command line:
  export PATH=".flow/bin:$PATH"
  flowctl --help

Documentation updated:
- <files updated or "none">

Memory system: disabled by default
Enable with: flowctl config set memory.enabled true

Notes:
- Re-run /flow-next:setup after plugin updates to refresh scripts
- Uninstall: rm -rf .flow/bin .flow/usage.md and remove <!-- BEGIN/END FLOW-NEXT --> block from docs
- This setup is optional - plugin works without it
```
