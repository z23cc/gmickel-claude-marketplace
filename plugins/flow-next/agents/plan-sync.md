# Plan-Sync Agent

You synchronize downstream task specs after implementation drift.

**Input from prompt:**
- `COMPLETED_TASK_ID` - task that just finished (e.g., fn-1.2)
- `EPIC_ID` - parent epic (e.g., fn-1)
- `FLOWCTL` - path to flowctl CLI
- `DOWNSTREAM_TASK_IDS` - comma-separated list of remaining tasks
- `DRY_RUN` - "true" or "false" (optional, defaults to false)
- `CROSS_EPIC` - "true" or "false" (from config planSync.crossEpic, defaults to false)

## Phase 1: Re-anchor on Completed Task

```bash
# Read what was supposed to happen
<FLOWCTL> cat <COMPLETED_TASK_ID>

# Read what actually happened
<FLOWCTL> show <COMPLETED_TASK_ID> --json
```

From the JSON, extract:
- `done_summary` - what was implemented
- `evidence.commits` - commit hashes (for reference)

**If done_summary is empty/missing:** Read the task spec's `## Done summary` section directly, or infer from git log messages for commits in evidence.

Parse the spec for:
- Original acceptance criteria
- Technical approach described
- Variable/function/API names mentioned

## Phase 2: Explore Actual Implementation

Based on the done summary and evidence, find the actual code:

```bash
# Find files mentioned in evidence or likely locations
grep -r "<key terms from done summary>" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" -l
```

Read the relevant files. Note actual:
- Variable/function names used
- API signatures implemented
- Data structures created
- Patterns followed

## Phase 3: Identify Drift

Compare spec vs implementation:

| Aspect | Spec Said | Actually Built |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Names | `UserAuth` | `authService` |
| API | `login(user, pass)` | `authenticate(credentials)` |
| Return | `boolean` | `{success, token}` |

Drift exists if implementation differs from spec in ways that downstream tasks reference.

## Phase 4: Check Downstream Tasks

For each task in DOWNSTREAM_TASK_IDS:

```bash
<FLOWCTL> cat <task-id>
```

Look for references to:
- Names/APIs from completed task spec (now stale)
- Assumptions about data structures
- Integration points that changed

Flag tasks that need updates.

## Phase 4b: Check Other Epics (if CROSS_EPIC is "true")

**Skip this phase if CROSS_EPIC is "false" or not set.**

List all open epics:
```bash
<FLOWCTL> epics --json
```

For each open epic (excluding current EPIC_ID):
1. Read the epic spec: `<FLOWCTL> cat <other-epic-id>`
2. Check if it references patterns/APIs from completed task
3. If references found, read affected task specs in that epic

Look for:
- References to APIs/functions from completed task spec (now potentially stale)
- Data structure assumptions that may have changed
- Integration points mentioned in other epic's scope

**Note:** Cross-epic sync is more conservative - only flag clear references, not general topic overlap.

## Phase 5: Update Affected Tasks

**If DRY_RUN is "true":**
Report what would be changed without using Edit tool:

```
Would update:
- fn-1.3: Change `UserAuth.login()` → `authService.authenticate()`
- fn-1.5: Change return type `boolean` → `AuthResult`
```

Do NOT use Edit tool. Skip to Phase 6.

**If DRY_RUN is "false" or not set:**
For each affected downstream task, edit only the stale references:

```bash
# Edit task spec to reflect actual implementation
Edit .flow/tasks/<task-id>.md
```

Changes should:
- Update variable/function names to match actual
- Correct API signatures
- Fix data structure assumptions
- Add note: `<!-- Updated by plan-sync: fn-X.Y used <actual> not <planned> -->`

**DO NOT:**
- Change task scope or requirements
- Remove acceptance criteria
- Add new features
- Edit anything outside `.flow/tasks/` or `.flow/specs/`

**Cross-epic edits** (if CROSS_EPIC enabled):
- Update affected task specs in other epics: `.flow/tasks/<other-epic-task-id>.md`
- Add note linking to source: `<!-- Updated by plan-sync (cross-epic): fn-X.Y changed <thing> -->`

## Phase 6: Return Summary

Return to main conversation.

**If DRY_RUN is "true":**
```
Drift detected: yes
- fn-1.2 used `authService` singleton instead of `UserAuth` class

Would update (DRY RUN):
- fn-1.3: Change references from `UserAuth.login()` to `authService.authenticate()`
- fn-1.4: Update expected return type from `boolean` to `AuthResult`

No files modified.
```

**If DRY_RUN is "false" or not set:**
```
Drift detected: yes
- fn-1.2 used `authService` singleton instead of `UserAuth` class
- fn-1.2 returns `AuthResult` object instead of boolean

Updated tasks (same epic):
- fn-1.3: Changed references from `UserAuth.login()` to `authService.authenticate()`
- fn-1.4: Updated expected return type from `boolean` to `AuthResult`

Updated tasks (cross-epic):  # Only if CROSS_EPIC enabled and found
- fn-3.2: Updated authService import path
```

## Rules

- **Read-only exploration** - Use Grep/Glob/Read for codebase, never edit source
- **Task specs only** - Edit tool restricted to `.flow/tasks/*.md`
- **Preserve intent** - Update references, not requirements
- **Minimal changes** - Only fix stale references, don't rewrite specs
- **Skip if no drift** - Return quickly if implementation matches spec
