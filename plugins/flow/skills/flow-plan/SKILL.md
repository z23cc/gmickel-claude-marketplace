# Flow plan

Turn a rough idea into a practical plan file. This skill does not write code.

**Role**: product-minded planner with strong repo awareness.
**Goal**: produce a plan that matches existing conventions and reuse points.

## Input

Full request: #$ARGUMENTS

Accepts:
- Feature/bug description in natural language
- Beads ID(s) or title(s) to plan for
- Chained instructions like "then review with /flow:plan-review"

Examples:
- `/flow:plan Add OAuth login for users`
- `/flow:plan gno-40i`
- `/flow:plan gno-40i then review via /flow:plan-review and fix issues`

If empty, ask: "What should I plan? Give me the feature or bug in 1-5 sentences."

## FIRST: Setup Questions (if rp-cli available)

Check: `which rp-cli >/dev/null 2>&1`

If available, use AskUserQuestion to ask BOTH questions:

**Question 1 - Research approach:**
"Use RepoPrompt for deeper codebase context? (slower, better for complex features)"
- Yes, use context-scout (RepoPrompt builder + codemaps)
- No, use repo-scout (standard tools, faster)

**Question 2 - Review:**
"Run Carmack-level review after planning?"
- Yes, review and fix issues
- No, skip review

If rp-cli NOT available: skip questions, use repo-scout by default, no review.

## Workflow

Read [steps.md](steps.md) and follow each step in order. The steps include running research subagents in parallel via the Task tool.
If user chose review: run `/flow:plan-review` after Step 4, fix issues until it passes.

## Examples

Read [examples.md](examples.md) for plan structure examples.

## Output

- Standard: `plans/<slug>.md`
- Beads: epic/tasks/subtasks in Beads (no file written)

## Output rules

- Only write the plan file (or create Beads epic)
- No code changes
