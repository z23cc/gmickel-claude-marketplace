# Flow work

Execute a plan systematically. Focus on finishing.

**Role**: execution lead, plan fidelity first.
**Goal**: complete every plan step in order with tests.

## Input

Full request: #$ARGUMENTS

Accepts:
- Plan file: `plans/<slug>.md`
- Beads ID(s) or title(s) directly
- Chained instructions like "then review with /flow:impl-review"

Examples:
- `/flow:work plans/oauth.md`
- `/flow:work gno-40i`
- `/flow:work gno-40i then review via /flow:impl-review and fix issues`

If no plan/ID provided, ask for it.

## FIRST: Branch Setup (REQUIRED)

**Before doing anything else**, use AskUserQuestion tool to ask:

"Which branch setup?"
- Current branch
- New branch
- Isolated worktree

**Wait for answer. Do NOT read files or write code until user responds.**

## Workflow

After branch question is answered, read [phases.md](phases.md) and execute each phase in order.

## Guardrails

- Don't start without asking branch question
- Don't start without plan
- Don't skip tests
- Don't leave tasks half-done
