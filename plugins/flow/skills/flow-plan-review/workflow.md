# Plan Review Workflow

## Phase 0: Window Selection

**CRITICAL**: Always start by listing windows and selecting the correct one.

```bash
# List all windows with their workspaces
rp-cli -e 'windows'
```

Output shows window IDs with workspace names. **Identify the window for the project you're reviewing.**

For all subsequent commands, use `-w <id>` to target that window:
```bash
# Example: target window 1
rp-cli -w 1 -e 'tree --folders'
```

**Optional: Bind to a specific tab** if the workspace has multiple compose tabs:
```bash
# List tabs in the window
rp-cli -w 1 -e 'call manage_workspaces {"action":"list_tabs"}'

# Bind to a tab (use name or UUID)
rp-cli -w 1 -e 'call manage_workspaces {"action":"select_tab","tab":"MyReviewTab"}'
```

## Phase 1: Parse Arguments & Read the Plan

Extract plan file from arguments (first path-like argument). Additional text = focus areas/context.

### Beads Input Handling

If Beads is in use (.beads/ exists, CLAUDE.md mentions it, or user explicitly passes Beads input), resolve:
1. If file exists: standard markdown plan
2. Else try `bd show <arg>` - if succeeds, treat as Beads ID
3. Else try `bd search "<arg>"` - if unique match, use that issue

If Beads ID:
1. Fetch content: `bd show <id>` (text output is clean, includes children)
2. Include output directly in the chat prompt
3. Continue with builder for codebase context

Agent will notice and adapt if output has escaping issues.

### Standard (file path)

Read the plan file (replace W with your window ID from Phase 0):
```bash
rp-cli -w W -e 'read <plan-file-from-args>'
```

Then search for supporting documentation:
```bash
# Find PRD if exists
rp-cli -w W -e 'search "PRD" --mode path'
rp-cli -w W -e 'search "prd_" --mode path'

# Find beads JSONL (Beads uses .beads/issues.jsonl, not individual files)
rp-cli -w W -e 'search ".beads/" --mode path'

# Find architecture docs
rp-cli -w W -e 'search "architecture" --mode path'
rp-cli -w W -e 'search "docs/" --mode path'
```

Read any relevant supporting docs you find (PRD, beads issue, architecture).

---

## Phase 2: Build Context

Call `builder` with instructions derived from the plan. Include:
- What the plan is trying to achieve
- Key modules/areas it touches
- Any patterns or dependencies mentioned

```bash
rp-cli -w W -e 'builder "Build context for reviewing this implementation plan: [SUMMARIZE PLAN GOALS]. Focus on: [KEY MODULES/AREAS FROM PLAN]. Include related architecture, tests, and dependency patterns."'
```

⚠️ **WAIT**: Builder takes 30s-5min. Do NOT proceed until it returns output.

After builder completes, add the plan file and any supporting docs to selection:
```bash
rp-cli -w W -e 'select add <plan-file>'
# Add PRD, beads issue, etc if found
rp-cli -w W -e 'select add docs/prd_xxx.md'
# Note: Beads data is in JSONL, use `bd show <id>` to get issue details
```

Verify selection:
```bash
rp-cli -w W -e 'select get'
```

---

## Phase 3: Verify and Augment Selection

The context builder is AI-driven and non-deterministic—it may miss relevant files. **Always verify the selection before proceeding.**

```bash
# Check what builder selected
rp-cli -w W -e 'select get'
```

Common gaps to check for:
- The plan file itself
- PRD or requirements docs
- Related architecture docs
- Existing code the plan references
- Similar implementations to compare against

Add anything missing:
```bash
rp-cli -w W -e 'select add path/to/plan.md'
rp-cli -w W -e 'select add docs/architecture.md'
```

**Why this matters:** The chat only sees selected files. Missing context = incomplete review.

---

## Phase 4: Carmack-Level Review

Use chat in **chat mode** to conduct the review. The chat sees all selected files completely.

**Shell escaping note:** Complex prompts with `?`, `()`, etc. may fail with zsh glob errors. Use heredoc:
```bash
rp-cli -w W -e "$(cat <<'PROMPT'
chat "..."
PROMPT
)"
```

Example prompt structure:
```bash
rp-cli -w W -e 'chat "Conduct a John Carmack-level code review of this implementation plan.

## The Plan
[PASTE PLAN CONTENT - for Beads, include `bd show` output here]

## Additional Context from User
[INCLUDE ANY FOCUS AREAS/COMMENTS FROM ARGUMENTS]

## Review Criteria

Evaluate against these world-class engineering standards:

### 1. Simplicity & Minimalism
- Is this the simplest possible solution?
- Any unnecessary abstraction layers?
- Could fewer files/functions achieve the same result?
- Solving problems we don't have yet (YAGNI)?

### 2. DRY & Code Reuse
- Any duplicated logic that should be extracted?
- Reinventing existing utilities in the codebase?
- Could existing patterns/helpers be leveraged?

### 3. Idiomatic Code
- Does it follow the codebase's established patterns?
- Language/framework idioms being violated?
- Naming conventions consistent with existing code?

### 4. Architecture & Design
- Does the data flow make sense?
- Are boundaries/responsibilities clear?
- Will this scale appropriately?
- Any circular dependencies introduced?

### 5. Edge Cases & Error Handling
- What failure modes are unhandled?
- Race conditions possible?
- Input validation sufficient?

### 6. Testability
- Is the proposed structure easily testable?
- Are dependencies injectable?
- What's hard to unit test in this design?

### 7. Performance
- Any obvious O(n²) or worse algorithms?
- Unnecessary allocations or copies?
- Could caching help?

### 8. Security
- Any injection vulnerabilities?
- Auth/authz gaps?
- Secrets handling appropriate?

### 9. Maintainability
- Will future developers understand this easily?
- Are abstractions earning their complexity?
- Clear separation of concerns?
- Dependencies well-managed?

## Expected Output

For each issue found:
1. **Severity**: Critical / Major / Minor / Nitpick
2. **Location**: Where in the plan
3. **Problem**: What's wrong
4. **Suggestion**: How to fix it
5. **Rationale**: Why this matters

End with:
- Overall assessment (Ship / Needs Work / Major Rethink)
- Top 3 changes that would most improve the plan
- Any patterns from the codebase the plan should adopt" --mode chat --new-chat --name "Plan Review: [PLAN_NAME]"'
```

---

## Iteration

Continue the chat to drill deeper if needed:
```bash
rp-cli -w W -e 'chat "Elaborate on the [SPECIFIC CONCERN]. What exactly would you change?" --mode chat'
```

---

## Key Guidelines

**Always use -w flag:** Every rp-cli command (except `windows`) needs `-w <id>` to target the correct window. W = your window ID from Phase 0.

**Token budget:** Stay under ~160k tokens. Builder manages this, but verify with `select get`.

**Chat sees only selection:** Ensure the plan file, PRD, and relevant code are all selected before starting the review chat.

---

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Forgetting `-w <id>` flag** – commands will fail with "Multiple windows" error
- Skipping `builder` – you'll miss architectural context
- Reviewing without PRD/beads context – you won't know the "why"
- Shallow review – thorough analysis takes time; don't rush
- Not selecting supporting docs – chat can't see what's not selected
- Asking chat to implement – review only; implementation is separate
