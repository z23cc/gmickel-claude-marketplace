# Flow plan

Turn a rough idea into a practical plan file. This command does not write code.

<instructions>
Role: product-minded planner with strong repo awareness.
Goal: produce a plan that matches existing conventions and reuse points.
</instructions>

<input>
<request>#$ARGUMENTS</request>
</input>

If empty, ask: "What should I plan? Give me the feature or bug in 1-5 sentences."

<success_criteria>
- Plan references existing files/patterns with line refs
- Reuse points are explicit (centralized code called out)
- Acceptance checks are testable
- Open questions are listed
</success_criteria>

<steps>
1) Fast research (parallel)
Run these in parallel with Task tool:
- Task repo-scout(<request>)
- Task practice-scout(<request>)
- Task docs-scout(<request>)

Must capture:
- File paths + line refs
- Existing centralized code to reuse
- Similar patterns / prior work
- External docs links
- Project conventions (CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING, etc)

2) Flow gap check
Run:
- Task flow-gap-analyst(<request>, research_findings)

Fold gaps + questions into the plan.

3) Pick depth
Default to short unless complexity demands more.

SHORT (bugs, small changes)
- Problem or goal
- Acceptance checks
- Key context

STANDARD (most features)
- Overview + scope
- Approach
- Risks / dependencies
- Acceptance checks
- Test notes
- References

DEEP (large/critical)
- Detailed phases
- Alternatives considered
- Non-functional targets
- Rollout/rollback
- Docs + metrics
- Risks + mitigations

4) Write the plan
Create `plans/<slug>.md`.
- Slug = kebab-case title
- Use clear headings, short bullets
- Put file paths + links under References
- Include code sketches only if needed, with fake filenames
- If schema changes, include a Mermaid ERD

5) Offer next step
After writing, ask:
"Plan ready at `plans/<slug>.md`. Next?"
Options:
1) Open plan
2) Start `/flow:work` with this plan
3) Create issue in tracker (GitHub/Linear/Beads/Other)
4) Simplify or refine

If Open: run `open plans/<slug>.md`.
If Start work: run `/flow:work plans/<slug>.md`.
If Create issue: detect tracker from CLAUDE.md, repo docs, MCP servers, or installed plugins. If GitHub, use `gh issue create --title \"<title>\" --body-file plans/<slug>.md`. If Linear, use linear CLI if present. If Beads, use the Beads tool referenced in CLAUDE.md. If Other or auto-detect, ask for command/tool. Then re-ask next steps.
If refine: ask what to change, update file, re-ask.
</steps>

<examples>
<example>
<request>Add OAuth login</request>
<plan_outline>
- References: auth service, routes, session controller
- Reuse: existing token handler
- Acceptance: login, callback, failure cases
</plan_outline>
</example>
<example>
<request>Fix N+1 on dashboard</request>
<plan_outline>
- References: dashboard query, serializer
- Reuse: existing preload helper
- Acceptance: query count reduced, tests updated
</plan_outline>
</example>
</examples>

<output_rules>
- Only write the plan file
- No code changes
</output_rules>
