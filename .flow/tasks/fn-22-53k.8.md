# fn-22-53k.8 skill: update flow-next-work for completion_review status

## Description

Update `/flow-next:work` skill to handle `status=completion_review` from selector.

**Changes to `plugins/flow-next/skills/flow-next-work/`:**

1. **`phases.md`** — Add handling for when `flowctl next` returns `status=completion_review`:
   - Detect status after all tasks complete
   - Run `/flow-next:epic-review <epic-id>`
   - On SHIP: set `completion_review_status=ship`, epic can close
   - On NEEDS_WORK: fix loop runs (same as Ralph)

2. **`SKILL.md`** — Document completion_review behavior in interactive mode

**Pattern reference:** See how plan-review is handled when `status=plan` is returned

**NOTE:** Without this, interactive `/flow-next:work fn-N` will fail when selector returns `completion_review` after all tasks done.

## Acceptance

- [ ] `/flow-next:work fn-N` handles `status=completion_review` from selector
- [ ] Invokes `/flow-next:epic-review` when completion review needed
- [ ] Fix loop runs until SHIP verdict
- [ ] Sets `completion_review_status=ship` after passing review
